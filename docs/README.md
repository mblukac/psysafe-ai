# PsySafe AI Documentation Overview

This document provides an overview of the documentation structure for the PsySafe AI project.

## Main Landing Page: `index.html`

The file [`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html) serves as the primary landing page for the PsySafe AI project. It offers a comprehensive introduction to the project's goals, features, and how to get started.

### Key Sections

The `index.html` page is structured into several key sections:

1.  **Introduction (`#about`)**: Provides a high-level overview of PsySafe AI, its purpose, and the problem it aims to solve. It emphasizes building safer AI systems by providing a modular, extensible framework for integrating psychological safety measures.
2.  **Core Capabilities/Features (`#features`)**: Highlights the main functionalities of PsySafe AI. This includes five core guardrails:
    *   Vulnerability Detection Guardrail
    *   Suicide Prevention Guardrail
    *   Mental Health Support Guardrail
    *   Complaints Handling Guardrail
    *   PII Protection Guardrail
3.  **Getting Started (`#getting-started`)**: Offers a quick guide for developers to install and begin using the `psysafe-ai` library, including installation commands and a brief code example.
4.  **Architecture (`#architecture`)**: Describes the modular design of the PsySafe AI framework, covering:
    *   Core Components
    *   Catalog System
    *   Driver Abstraction (supporting multiple LLM providers)
    *   Evaluation Framework
5.  **Footer**: Contains links to important project resources such as the GitHub repository, documentation, community channels (issues, discussions), and examples.

### Visual Design Principles

The landing page employs a professional and clean visual design. The color scheme is intentionally chosen to evoke trust and safety:
*   **Blues** (e.g., `primary-color: #2563eb`, `secondary-color: #1e40af`) are used to instill a sense of trust, stability, and professionalism.
*   **Greens** (e.g., `accent-color: #10b981`) are incorporated to represent safety, well-being, and positive action.

### Logo Update

The project logo has been updated from the previous capybara image to the new [`psysafe_logo.png`](../assets/imgs/psysafe_logo.png), which is featured prominently on the landing page.

### Alignment with Project Mission

The design, content, and structure of [`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html) are carefully crafted to align with PsySafe AI's core mission: to advance psychological safety in AI systems. The page clearly communicates the project's commitment to protecting users, ensuring ethical AI interactions, and providing developers with the tools to build more responsible AI applications.
